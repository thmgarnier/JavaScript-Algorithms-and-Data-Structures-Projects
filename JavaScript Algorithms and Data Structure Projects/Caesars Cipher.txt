/* 
One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is
a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher.
In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted
by some set amount.

A common modern use is the ROT13 cipher,
where the values of the letters are shifted by 13 places.
Thus A <-> N, B <-> O, and so on.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input
and returns a decoded string.

All letters will be uppercase. Do not ransform any non-alphabetic
character (i.e. spaces, puntuation), but do pass them on.
